Learning Log:

• Make at least four separate entries reasonably spaced over a period of atleast six weeks
• The entries can either be separate files or different sections within the same file.
• They should be written using Markdown and stored in a private repository on GitHub.
• You need to commit and push each entry as you make it so that the dates of the entries are correctly recorded in git.
• You can include images and external links. For each entry identify:
• What you have done (to learn your skill and contribute to your project)
• What you have learned
• Any changes to your goals (or what your initial goals are for the firstentry)
• Next step(s) to achieve your goalsThe learning log should have a maximum total word count of 1500 words, asmeasured by the Microsoft VS Code Word Count plugin and have a reasonablebalance between the entries

Entry 1:

• Any changes to your goals (or what your initial goals are for the first entry).

- The goal is to cover the bulk of the coursera Andrew Ng Machine Learning course content and build an unsupervised machine learning model (potentially image classification).

• What you have done (to learn your skill and contribute to your project)?

- I have enrolled in the Andrew Ng Machine Learning course on coursera and completed the first week of the

• What you have learned?

- I have completed week 1 of course, titled "Introduction to Machine Learning"
- I have learned about the subfields of supervised ML (regression, classification etc.) and unsupervised ML, as well as cost functions and training a model with gradient descent.

• Next step(s) to achieve your goals:

- Complete the first 3 weeks of the Andrew Ng course whilst taking notes and thinking of specific project ideas.

Entry 2:

• What you have done (to learn your skill and contribute to your project)

- I have now covered weeks 1 - 3 of the coursera Andrew Ng Machine Learning course content. I have watched all of the videos and taken notes.

• What you have learned?

In short, the content covered included:

- Week 2: Multiple linear regression, vectorisation (making code implementation of ML algorithms much shorter and code run faster), gradient descent with multiple linear regression, (including feature scaling, learning rates, feature engineering, polynomial regression etc.)

- Week 3: Logistic regression (which predicts the probability that something is true or false, therefore normally used for classification), decision boundaries, the logistic loss function for gradient descent, the logistic regression gradient descent algorithm, bias and variance, overfitting and the ways of reducing it.

• Any changes to your goals?

- We're still set on an image classification project. I'll complete the first 6 weeks of the Andrew Ng course so that I have a basic understanding of the background mathematics of a CNN image classification algorithm, although I'll obviously use a library to implement the model anyway.

• Next steps:

- Source data for said project
- Specify a model (with parameters, cost function, gradient descent algorithm etc) and train said model on the data.
- Undergo an iterative process of evaluating the bias/variance of the model and improving it based off these two factors.
