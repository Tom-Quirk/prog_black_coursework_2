• What you have learned
• Any changes to your goals (or what your initial goals are for the firstentry)
• Next step(s) to achieve your goalsThe learning log should have a maximum total word count of 1500 words, asmeasured by the Microsoft VS Code Word Count plugin and have a reasonablebalance between the entries

Entry 1:

• Any changes to your goals (or what your initial goals are for the first entry).

• What you have done (to learn your skill and contribute to your project)?

- I have enrolled in the Andrew Ng Machine Learning course on coursera and completed the first week of the

• What you have learned?

- I have completed week 1 of course, titled "Introduction to Machine Learning"
- I have learned about the subfields of supervised ML (regression, classification etc.) and unsupervised ML, as well as cost functions and training a model with gradient descent.

• Next step(s) to achieve your goals:
