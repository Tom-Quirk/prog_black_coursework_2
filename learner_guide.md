Guide for learners structure
• Motivation (10%): Why learn it?

- This is a learner's guide on how to build a CNN that accurately classifies dog images.

- In the Big Data era, Machine Learning has become a way for companies to understand and exploit data. ML is used to enhance decision making, optimising customer retention, revenue generation and cost cutting.

- Because the potential upside for companies can be so lucrative, they are willing to pay high salaries to proficient Machine Learning Engineers, Data Scientists and Data Analysts.

- A career in ML may offer the opportunity to work on some of the most innovative projects in the entire technology industry. For instance, a research-oriented company called Google Deepmind spearheaded an effort to develop an ML algorithm to reliably determine a protein’s structure from its sequence of amino acids alone. Understanding a protein's structure is crucial to the rapid development of new life-saving drugs. Their 4 year project, titled "AlphaFold", more than doubled the number of high-accuracy human protein structures available to scientists, and Google Deepmind's partners are "using AlphaFold and the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database to accelerate progress on important real-world problems including breaking down single-use plastics, solving biological puzzles and finding new drugs to treat liver cancer. By reducing the need for slow and expensive experiments, AlphaFold has potentially saved the research world up to one billion years of progress – and trillions of dollars."

- By studying convolutional neural networks and putting one into practice, you will gain a basic understanding of the key components of any kind of neural network and the underlying mathematics. This project provides a solid first stepping stone into future ML projects and the exciting end product of an image classification algorithm that can identify dogs.

• Background (10%): What do you need to know before starting? Include links to material to catch up. Make it clear who your target audience is.

    - This learning guide is targeted at learners who know have a basic working proficiency in python but have no experience with machine learning whatsoever. If you don't know python then you can use either of the below resources:

        - https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-programming-with-python
        - https://www.amazon.co.uk/Learn-Python-Hard-Way-Introduction/dp/0321884914

    - To write code, I recommend using the VSCode developer environment. Download VSCode using the link:

        - https://code.visualstudio.com/download

• Learning materials (10%):

- Before implementing a CNN, it's a good idea to gain an understanding of the fundamentals of a neural network. To do this, work through the first 6 weeks of the coursera machine learning specialization below:
  - https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/week/1
- If you're confused by any of the statistics/mathematics involved and require further help, this youtube channel provides simple and concise explanations about key ML concepts:

- Now that you're familiar with python and the basics of a machine learning model, you need to learn TensorFlow.

- To download TensorFlow, use the terminal commands here: https://www.tensorflow.org/install

- To learn TensorFlow, read the documentation and watch the video tutorials on the TensorFlow website here: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials

• Evaluation (10%): How useful is the skill, compared with the effort of learning it? What similar alternatives are there?

- • Presentation (10%)The presentation mark (10%) will be awarded on the basis of:

- formatting in (GitHub flavored) Markdown
- choice of media (images, video)
- clear writing style appropriate for audience. The guide for learners should have a maximum total word count of 1500 words,as measured by the Microsoft VS Code wordcount plugin.
