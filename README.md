- I completed entries 1-3 from late February (when I started the Andrew Ng course) to last Sunday night. 
- The final project was done over the last few days and the fourth entry was completed last night.
- Although I saved changes locally, I didn't realise that the date of commit displayed on the remote repo would be whenever I pushed it up. Hence the terrible spread commits.
